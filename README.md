# OBS Websocket Remote Control

https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-current/docs/generated/protocol.md#requests

Starting with obs-websocket 4.9, authentication is enabled by default and users are encouraged to configure a password on first run.

obs-websocket uses SHA256 to transmit credentials.

A request for GetAuthRequired returns two elements:

A challenge: a random string that will be used to generate the auth response.
A salt: applied to the password when generating the auth response.
To generate the answer to the auth challenge, follow this procedure:

Concatenate the user declared password with the salt sent by the server (in this order: password + server salt).
Generate a binary SHA256 hash of the result and encode the resulting SHA256 binary hash to base64, known as a base64 secret.
Concatenate the base64 secret with the challenge sent by the server (in this order: base64 secret + server challenge).
Generate a binary SHA256 hash of the result and encode it to base64.
Voil√†, this last base64 string is the auth response. You may now use it to authenticate to the server with the Authenticate request.
Pseudo Code Example:

password = "supersecretpassword"
challenge = "ztTBnnuqrqaKDzRM3xcVdbYm"
salt = "PZVbYpvAnZut2SS6JNJytDm9"

secret_string = password + salt
secret_hash = binary_sha256(secret_string)
secret = base64_encode(secret_hash)

auth_response_string = secret + challenge
auth_response_hash = binary_sha256(auth_response_string)
auth_response = base64_encode(auth_response_hash)
